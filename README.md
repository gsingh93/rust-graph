Rust Graph [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gsingh93/rust-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gsingh93/rust-graph)
==========

**Note**: This library was created a while ago so I could learn Rust. The API isn't very good and the code isn't very good, so I wouldn't recommend using this library. For a better alternative, see [petgraph](https://github.com/bluss/petulant-avenger-graphlibrary). I will not be adding new code to this library, but I will be maintaining it in the case of bugs/breaking changes.

A library for creating and operating on graphs. See the examples folder for usage information.
